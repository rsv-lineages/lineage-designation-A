# Lineage designations for RSV-A
This respository contains the definitions of lineages for RSV-A following the proposal put forward in [**The unified proposal for classification of human respiratory syncytial virus below the subgroup level**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.13.24302237v1) by Goya et al and the RSV Genotyping Consensus Consortium.

Please refer to the preprint for a in-depth discussion of the lineages and nomenclature. You can assign your own sequence data to the different lineages using [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org) or [UShER](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace).
